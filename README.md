# about me
Hello, I'm Mifu Inouye ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 22-year-old System Engineer based in Tokyo, Japan. With a background as an Electrician, I've always been fascinated by IT technology, and that's why I decided to become an engineer.

Although I'm relatively new to the field, I'm highly committed to learning and improving my skills every day. 

The languages I primarily use for building and developing systems are:
- Golang
- TypeScript
- Java

I aim not only to become a top-notch engineer, but also to develop as an individual with a great personality. 

My dream is to bring innovation to the world through IT technology.

Feel free to explore my GitHub to see the projects that I'm currently working on and have completed in the past.
